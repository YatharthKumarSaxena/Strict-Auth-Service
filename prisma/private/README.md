# üîí Prisma Private Schema - Internal System Tables

This folder contains the **internal system schema** used by the backend to manage admin-only operations, logs, rate limits, and block controls. These tables are **never exposed to clients directly** and are only accessed through system services or admin-verified routes.

The private schema helps enforce **security**, **traceability**, and **control** across the system.

---

## üìñ **Introduction**

As my backend system matured, I separated internal logic (like logs, rate limits, device blocks) from public-facing user tables. This allowed for:

- Reduced risk of data leaks  
- Clear role separation between users and admins  
- Scalable enforcement of rate limits and device safety

This private schema runs with its own client and uses a separate environment variable `PRIVATE_DB_URL`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Prisma Generator & Datasource**

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/.prisma/private"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("PRIVATE_DB_URL")
}
```

## üß© Enum Definitions

Enums make the schema type-safe and strictly controlled. Here's what each enum controls:

### üîê `AuthLogEvent`
Defines all actions that are logged for auditing:
- `LOGIN`, `LOGOUT`, `BLOCKED_USER`, `REGISTER`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, etc.
- Also includes cleanup and admin-triggered actions.

### üíª `DeviceType`
Specifies which device initiated the request:
- `LAPTOP`, `MOBILE`, `TABLET`

### üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è `PerformedBy`
Who performed the action:
- `CUSTOMER`, `ADMIN`, `SYSTEM`

### üö´ `DeviceBlockReason`
Why a device was blocked:
- `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`, `UNKNOWN_DEVICE_LOGIN`, etc.

### ‚úÖ `DeviceUnblockReason`
Why a device was unblocked:
- `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `MANUAL_REVIEW_CLEARED`, etc.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Strategy

‚úÖ No user can access these tables directly  
‚úÖ All insert/update operations are done by middlewares or system scripts  
‚úÖ Helps trace all admin-level activities with full logs and metadata  
‚úÖ Ensures auditability for rate limits, token issues, and user actions  

---

## üéØ **Final Takeaway**

This `private` schema serves as the **nervous system** of the backend, ensuring:

- Admin actions are tracked
- Devices can be blacklisted in real-time
- No client bypasses security controls
- Every event is logged and audit-ready

By separating internal logic here, my backend remains **clean**, **secure**, and **future-proof**.
