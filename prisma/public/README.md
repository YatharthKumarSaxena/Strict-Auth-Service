# üåê Prisma Public Schema - User-Facing Authentication Tables

This folder defines the **public-facing data schema** for the authentication service. These models represent the **core of user identity**, their **devices**, **OTP verification**, and **block/unblock workflows**. It connects directly to your sign-up, login, and session lifecycle.

---

## üìñ **Introduction**

The `public` schema is the **backbone of all authentication operations**. It tracks:
- üîê Registered users and their credentials  
- üì± Devices and usage patterns  
- üîÑ OTP flow for phone/email verification  
- üö´ Block/unblock logic for abuse prevention

This schema powers the **external user-facing routes**, unlike the `private/` schema which supports internal admin and logging utilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Prisma Generator & Datasource**

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "../../node_modules/.prisma/public"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("PUBLIC_DB_URL")
}
```

## üß© Enum Definitions

Enums ensure type safety and consistent naming across services:

### üë• `UserType`
Defines who the user is:
- `CUSTOMER` ‚Äì General end-user  
- `ADMIN` ‚Äì Elevated privilege user  

### üß≠ `ViaType`
Used to mark **how** a block or unblock event occurred:
- `USER_ID`, `EMAIL`, `PHONE`

### üíª `DeviceType`
Specifies device from which request was made:
- `MOBILE`, `LAPTOP`, `TABLET`

### üö´ `BlockReason`
Why a user account was blocked:
- `POLICY_VIOLATION`, `SPAM_ACTIVITY`, `FRAUDULENT_BEHAVIOR`, etc.

### ‚úÖ `UnblockReason`
Why a user account was unblocked:
- `MANUAL_REVIEW_PASSED`, `USER_APPEAL_GRANTED`, `SYSTEM_ERROR`, etc.

## üîê Integrity & Security Notes

‚úÖ All sensitive fields are hashed or obfuscated  
‚úÖ One-to-one relations ensure no duplication  
‚úÖ Blocking and device data allow for high security policies  
‚úÖ JWT issue timestamps support session invalidation  

---

## üéØ **Final Takeaway**

This schema holds the **core logic** of user management:
- Clean and normalized design  
- All account lifecycle states are tracked  
- OTP and device flow is tightly coupled  
- Ready to scale for both admin and user scenarios

By splitting public and private schemas, I achieved:
- Better **modularity**
- Strong **security enforcement**
- Easier **maintenance** and **audit**

This `public` schema is the **identity engine** behind the entire authentication system.
